        Indian biodiversity Conservation society is a registered non-profit organization that started on 23rd July 2015 in a small city of Uttar Pradesh, Jhansi with the motive to study wildlife related problems and recommend management plans for in-situ conservation of wildlife. IBCS like to disseminate knowledge of flora and fauna by means of lectures, field trips, literature and expeditions and impart widespread environmental education and training through a vast network for teachers, students and communities. 

        We are interested in exploring remote ecosystems that are unprotected and still unexplored. Our main approach to wildlife management and conservation is to include the local people so as to gain their cooperation and support, which will eventually result in integrated conservation and development. 

        Throughout the journey so far, IBCS is actively involved in research projects and awareness drives. IBCS has also rescued and released various bird species including vultures, owls and peacocks. We have installed more than 7000 artificial nest boxes for House Sparrows in temple patios, schools and homes.  

        We believe in imparting environmental education centering around on various issues encouraging the students to understand and create associations with their direct environs. The understanding, awareness, and skills needed for the conservation, provide a base for moving out into larger systems, broader issues, and a more sophisticated comprehension of causes, connections, and consequences. 

        

        IBCS has designed a Green Calendar that has about 60 days related to various aspects of environment and species that need protection and attention. Accordingly, we have actively participated and organized various programmes such as World Sparrow day, World Wetlands Day, Earth day, International Vulture Awareness Day (IVAD), Wildlife Week, Vulture Census in Uttar Pradesh, International Day for Biological Diversity, World Environment Day.  

        We have organized a National webinar on “House Sparrow-Concerns And Conservation” on the occasion of World Sparrow Day, 20th March 2022. Another National webinar was organized on “Green Future Is A Prosperous Future” on the occasion of Earth Day, 22nd April 2022. In collaboration with Department of Zoology, L. N. D. College (NAAC B+ Accredited), Motihari, East Champaran on 8-9th July 2022, a National Seminar was organized on the topic “Sustainable Development and Management for Agriculture, Health & Nutrition, Livelihood & Environmental Security in Bihar IBCS has organized a number of workshops on preparation of artificial nest boxes for House Sparrows, bird watching and clay art.  

        We have several national and international collaborations for all such activities. Members and volunteers from all over India are assisting in achieving the aims and objectives of Indian Biodiversity Conservation Society.
